Render Pipeline 

Fabric renderer -> fabric lets react talk to each platform and manage its host views instances they exist in js and targets interfaces of c++
react manipulates the complex host tress to respond to the external events triggered by interactions, network responses, times and so on

Renderer controls the way react intereact with host environment 

works in two modes 
Mutating modes -> create a node and set its properties and later add or remove the children from it 

Persistent Mode -> clone the parent tree and always 

React Elements 




Stability 

Regularity 

host trees -> host instances which are the nodes, host instances could be values uniquely identifying a native view from js
Every host instances have their own properties 


Render -> product logic that creates a React Element Trees in js
